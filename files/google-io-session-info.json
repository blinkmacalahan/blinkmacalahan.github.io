Within a 4DSOUND landscape - M.L. generated sonic entities are created via N’Synth Super and Magenta Studio. These entities live and self-perpetuate, merging and interacting with the human voice, body and the environment. Originally commissioned by Dalai Lama - Experiment 1 was created in partnership with Dr. Eve Ekman of The Greater Good Science Center, Monom, Google AI, and digital opera artist Amanda Gregory. SP a T i AL is an immersive 4DSOUND audio environment dedicated to multi-sensory and multimedia performances. All artists featured in the space have incorporated A.I. & M.L. as a collaborative tool in their creations, showcasing classical disciplines reimagined through the use of pioneering technology.",
